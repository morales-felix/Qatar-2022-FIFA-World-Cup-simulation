    "As a soccer fan, this project was both fun and a step towards a future personal project. The real reason for this simulation was a World Cup bracket challenge with my coworkers. Was I the only one who did this? Did I win? Read on ðŸ˜‰\n",

    "This simulation uses Elo ratings from <https://eloratings.net> to measure team strength and update it after each simulated game. The Elo implementation is based on FiveThirtyEightâ€™s NFL forecasting game (<https://github.com/morales-felix/nfl-elo-game>).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Per <https://eloratings.net/about>, the K constant is set to 60 as this is a World Cup competition.  \n",
    "- Probabilities given by the Elo rating system are binary. I came up with a workaround to convert them to ternary probabilities given that association football (a.k.a. soccer) admits three outcomes after a match (win, tie, lose).  \n",
    "- I did not simulate scorelines. Rather, I simply used probabilities to decide whether a team would win, tie, or lose. As such, I did not use the goal difference multiplier specified in <https://eloratings.net/about>  \n",
    "- I'll be happy to talk about the workaround, but I wouldn't take it as gospel. There might be ways to do this, but I did not research it. Wanted to have fun, not produce an academic-paper-worthy method, nor a sellable product.  \n",
    "- In the end, results aren't that different from other more publicized methods. Brazil is a strong team... always."

    "LEARNINGS:  My simulations were predicting that Argentina was the team most likely to win the World Cup right at the end of the group stage/start of the knockout stage. But it so happens that I root for Argentina since my pre-teen years, and I've been conditioned to so much disappointment that I just couldn't bring myself to believe Argentina could win this World Cup.
