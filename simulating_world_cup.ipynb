    "Needless to say, I am a soccer fan (not too crazy though... As I continue to live on this Earth, I realize that fandom isn't a static thing). So this was a fun project which also helped me to start developing code for future personal project of mine. Full disclosure: One big motivation to do this was a World Cup bracket challenge that I played with my coworkers. As far as I can tell, I was the only one who did this sort of thing. Did I win the bracket? Read on ðŸ˜‰\n",

    "- Per <https://eloratings.net/about>, the K constant is set to 60 as this is a World Cup competition.  \n",
    "- Probabilities given by the Elo rating system are binary. I came up with a workaround to convert them to ternary probabilities given that association football (a.k.a. soccer) admits three outcomes after a match (win, tie, lose).  \n",
    "- I did not simulate scorelines. Rather, I simply used probabilities to decide whether a team would win, tie, or lose. As such, I did not use the goal difference multiplier specified in <https://eloratings.net/about>  \n",
    "- I'll be happy to talk about the workaround, but I wouldn't take it as gospel. There might be ways to do this, but I did not research it. Wanted to have fun, not produce an academic-paper-worthy method, nor a sellable product.  \n",
