# Simulating the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup  

## Introduction

As a soccer fan, this project was both fun and a step towards a future personal project. The real reason for this simulation was a World Cup bracket challenge with my coworkers. Was I the only one who did this? Did I win? Read on ðŸ˜‰

This simulation uses Elo ratings from <https://eloratings.net> to measure team strength and update it after each simulated game. The Elo implementation is based on FiveThirtyEightâ€™s NFL forecasting game (<https://github.com/morales-felix/nfl-elo-game>).
